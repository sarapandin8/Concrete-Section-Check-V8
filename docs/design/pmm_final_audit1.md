# PMM.FINAL.AUDIT1 - Flexural PMM Final-Readiness Audit

Milestone: `PMM.FINAL.AUDIT1`

This audit controls the path from the current Flexural PMM engineering-review
workflow toward a commercial final-status workflow. It does not change solver
equations, resistance factors, prestress stress logic, demand/capacity
extraction, or UI result status wording.

## Scope

- Member family: Column / Pier / Wall / Pylon - RC / Prestressed Member.
- Active subview: `Flexural (PMM)`.
- Checks covered: axial-biaxial PMM strength and ULS demand/capacity review.
- Checks not covered: shear, torsion, serviceability, detailing, development
  length, confinement detailing, second-order analysis, and construction-stage
  checks.

## Current implementation evidence

| Area | Current evidence | Readiness classification |
|---|---|---|
| PMM solver | `concrete_pmm_pro/analysis/pmm_solver.py` runs an ACI-oriented strain-compatibility PMM sweep. | Implemented, engineering-review |
| Demand/capacity | `concrete_pmm_pro/analysis/capacity_check.py` checks active ULS load cases against the PMM result. | Implemented, engineering-review |
| RC validation | `VALID.RC1`, `VALID.RC2`, hand checks, and PMM benchmark packs exist. | Strong candidate for next finalization milestone |
| Directional D/C | `VALID.PMM.DC1` and slice-envelope checks exist. | Implemented, still needs final reference cases |
| Prestress PMM | `VALID.PS1`, `VALID.PS2`, `SOLVER.PS.PASSIVE1`, `SOLVER.PS.STRESS1`, and `SOLVER.PS.COMP1` exist. | Implemented with retained prestress limitations |
| Axial cap | `QA.PO1` validates the prestress-aware ACI-style axial cap helper. | Candidate for method-note downgrade |
| AASHTO LRFD PMM | `AASHTO.COL.PMM1` adds a separate AASHTO LRFD 9th B-region axial-flexure route with SI-safe stress-block, phi, and axial-cap handling. | Implemented, engineering-review / not final code-certified |

## Final-status blockers

The current Flexural PMM workflow must not be relabeled as final or
code-certified until these blockers are closed by named milestones:

1. Published or independently traceable reference examples are still needed for
   RC uniaxial and true biaxial PMM capacity.
2. Directional D/C extraction needs final reference cases showing that the
   selected method does not overestimate capacity for non-circular and
   non-symmetric PMM envelopes.
3. Prestressed PMM needs published/reference examples for bonded active
   prestress behavior, stress-state policy, and governing-region effects.
4. Prestress compression reversal is not fully modeled; current behavior is a
   documented limitation and cannot be hidden as a final solver assumption.
5. Unbonded prestress is ignored by the PMM solver and must remain a hard
   limitation until a separate unbonded model exists.
6. AASHTO LRFD Column/Pier PMM is implemented by `AASHTO.COL.PMM1` as an engineering-review B-region axial-flexure route, but it is not yet a final code-certified AASHTO design solver. Shear, torsion, slenderness/second-order, seismic, hollow-wall local-buckling, development, and detailing checks remain guarded.
7. Neutral-axis sweep resolution and irregular-section numerical robustness
   need final acceptance criteria before final certification wording.
8. Validation must be runnable in the delivery environment. In this Codex
   runtime, validation execution was blocked by missing `shapely`, even though
   `requirements.txt` lists `shapely>=2.0`.

## Allowed status after this audit

The safest commercial wording after `PMM.FINAL.AUDIT1` is:

> Flexural PMM is an implemented engineering-review strength workflow with
> substantial validation evidence. It is not yet a final code-certified solver.

For ACI 318 Column/Pier PMM, the accepted closeout status is:

> Finalized production preview

This status is allowed only after `PMM.FINAL.RC1.STATUS.READINESS1` passes with
documented benchmark evidence and `PMM.FINAL.RC1.CLOSEOUT` keeps the UI/report
wording guarded against final certification claims.

For AASHTO LRFD Column/Pier PMM after `AASHTO.COL.PMM1`, the current status is:

> Implemented engineering-review route / not final code-certified

No AASHTO LRFD final PMM claim is allowed until independent reference examples, D/C extraction cases, prestress reference behavior, slenderness/seismic/detailing boundaries, and report-readiness wording are validated by later named milestones.

This audit does not change solver equations.

## Do-not-change rules

- Do not remove prototype or engineering-review wording solely to make the UI
  look final.
- Do not modify solver equations merely to make validation checks pass.
- Do not reuse Beam/Girder shear, torsion, or flexure readiness to certify
  Column/Pier PMM.
- Do not treat the AASHTO.COL.PMM1 engineering-review route as final code-certified AASHTO LRFD PMM.
- Do not hide unbonded prestress, compression reversal, convex-hull fallback,
  or D/C interpolation limitations from report/readiness outputs.

## Recommended next milestones

1. `PMM.FINAL.RC1.CLOSEOUT` - ACI 318 RC Column/Pier PMM finalized
   production-preview closeout:
   scope, uniaxial, biaxial, phi, D/C no-overestimate, UI/report wording, and
   certification guards.
2. Published/reference RC PMM examples for future code-certified ambitions:
   uniaxial, biaxial, and D/C examples before final certification wording.
3. `PMM.FINAL.PS1` - Bonded prestress final-readiness:
   active bonded prestress reference cases, compression-reversal policy, and
   prestress stress-state governance.
4. `AASHTO.COL.PMM1.VALIDATE1` - AASHTO LRFD Column/Pier PMM validation expansion:
   independent reference cases, biaxial demand/capacity checks, prestress cases, and final report-readiness guard review.
5. Future UI/report wording changes:
   keep `PMM.FINAL.RC1.CLOSEOUT` as the RC-only boundary and create a new named
   milestone before expanding PMM claims.
